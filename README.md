# Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike Data with Tableau
## Overview of the statistical analysis
This table story can be seen, in its entirety, [link to dashboard.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lily.hu5868)

The purpose of this analysis was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. So we create this visualization to give a chance to stakeholders to go directly to the results and make decisions.

## Results
1. The image below shows that more than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers, who make regular use of the bikes and are a predictable source of income for the program. And users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8, only about 1/4 female. The remaining 1/8 gender is unknown or undeclared. And the charting of average trip duration by birth year shows teenagers and early-twenty-somethings enjoy taking much longer bikerides than older users.

 2. This chart displays the number of bike rides initiated during each hour of the day, totaled across the entire month of August. We can see peak usage during morning rush hour and end-of-workday commute times. What is also of note is the low-usage hours between 2 AM and 5 AM. These hours would be the best times to conduct bike repairs and redistribution of bikes from full stations to less-full stations.

 3. Checkout Times for Users: We analyze the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders. As shown in the visualization, most bike riding occur in the first 20 minutes and then experiece a downward growth until the first hour. Finally, we observe a constant behaviour.

 5. Trips by weekday for Each Hour: We graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as following. It seems that this amount is more colorful between 6:00 Am and 8:00 Pm.

 6. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): We graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as following. As shown in the shaded section, this amount is more meaningful for male between 6:00 Am to 8:00 Pm.

 7. User Trips by Gender by Weekday: We visualize the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as following. This graph shows that male have more experience of trips on Thursdays and Fridays.

## Summay
In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.

We suggest additional visualizations for future analysis as follows:
1. Investors would like to know which bikes are most likely due for repair? The below treemap can give us a idea of how often each bike is used, and then note which ones are used most frequently.

 2. The image below shows bike utilization levels, if a bike has a higher utilization level, it will be a large bubble.
